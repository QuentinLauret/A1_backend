To do this project, I used two courses :

To use the app, you have to go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/guit.
This link allows you to register a new guitar, with an id, a price, a color, chose if the guitar is an electric one and its price.

You can see the list of all of the guitars on http://127.0.0.1:8000/listing. On this page, it is possible to edit or to delete a guitar.

The main issue in this project, was the understanding of the framework. At the beginning, I did not understand how to change the value of my table. But, thanks to the tutorials, I succeeded.

The extensions that could be added to the project are : some security, with an admin account, the possibility to add photos to the guitars registered.
